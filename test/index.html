            ABOUT MAN UNITED 
        </h2>
       <p> Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.<br>
        Manchester United have won the most trophies in English club football,[5][6] including a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions League titles, between 1986 and 2013.[7][8][9] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they also became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).<br>
        Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[11][12] and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[13] and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club</p>

<h2> History</h2>
     <p> Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

         <br>
         In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £300,000 in 2022[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[22]

         In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.[23] In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division </p>

    <h1> RYAN GIGGS</h1>
    <img src="ryan-giggs-the-man-for-all-seasons.jpg" width="400" height="600" >
    <p>
        Ryan Giggs closed one chapter of his football career - the epic, decades-spanning story of him as a player - on the same day he started a new one, as Manchester United’s new assistant manager.
        
        That day, Monday 19 May 2014, came nearly a fortnight after Giggs made what proved to be his final appearance on the field - in the Reds’ 3-1 win over Hull City at Old Trafford. At that time he was serving with a dual purpose, playing as a substitute but also managing the first team temporarily. The aptitude Ryan showed in his four-match stint in charge, and the knowledge he had amassed as a player at the club since 1990, made him an ideal right-hand man for new boss Louis van Gaal.
    <br>ad van Gaal arrived at Old Trafford in a previous year, he would have had the pleasure of selecting Giggs on his team sheet. The type of player he would have utilised would depend on the year in question - in more than two decades, Ryan adapted and evolved his style from daring and dashing tormentor of full-backs to latterly a calming influence in midfield with a sharp eye for a pass.

By 2013/14, his legs may have lost their explosive acceleration but his brain remained ahead of many a younger rival and his ability to produce telling crosses and assists was never better. In summary, the Welshman was a phenomenon as a footballer - a man to be treasured and talked about in revered tones long after his retirement.

Ryan is United's record appearance-maker of course; he surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton's 758 on the night he helped the Reds secure a third European Cup triumph - his second - in Moscow on 21 May 2008. His eventual total of 963 games for United will surely never be topped with one-club men seemingly now a breed of football’s past.

Yet United's most decorated player might never have graced Old Trafford, had it not been for Sir Alex Ferguson’s intervention. Cardiff-born Giggs was attending Manchester City's School of Excellence in his early teens, but Sir Alex made a personal visit to his house on his 14th birthday and Ryan jumped at the chance to sign for his boyhood favourites.His eventual total of 963 games for United will surely never be topped with one-club men seemingly now a breed of football’s past.
